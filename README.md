# Tips for UCL Computer Science MSc

- intro text
- advice tailored to doing as well as possible, as efficiently as possible, optimising for a software engineering job on the other side

## Module Tips

### COMP0066 - Introductory Programming

- Learn Python, project is group to code a simple Python project
    - should learn and be comfortable with Python before course starts. You technically don't need to but you will not be good enough for job interviews if you can't learn that yourself
- your group will make or break your grade unfortunately

### COMP0068 - Computer Architecture and Operating Systems

- learn binary addition and subtraction before module, will be a lot easier
- will be taught assembly (MIPS32). Good practice for exam revision: https://github.com/rohitdwivedula/mips-exercises
- best way to learn MIPS is to practice it a lot, like any programming language

### COMP0070 - Algorithmics

- go over Neetcode's course on algorithms before module starts, good explanations
- if you don't have a maths background, you will need to put in a lot of extra effort to understand it, but it does make sense eventually - learning it sets foundation for rest of course

### COMP0178 - Database Fundamentals

- learn SQL, HTML, CSS before module starts, will be a lot easier
- we had group project in PHP and SQL.
- most important module for system design interviews
- relational algebra seems scary at first but during revision, it makes a lot more sense, particularly when doing past papers

### SPCE0038 - ML Big Data

- should be aware of the fundamentals of ML before (e.g. linear regression, logistic, nearest neighbours etc)


### COMP0020 - Functional Programming

- harder module but one of the best for computer science / software engineering careers
- uses Miranda
- requires decent amount of extra work and practice but very worth it. one of the most useful modules

### COMP0067 - App Engineering

- one of the best projects if your group is good
- expect to do a lot of programming for it but most indicative of real world software engineering
- asking for more difficult project can screw you over by making you team leader of less experienced group

## Job Tips

- when to start?
    - if leetcoded before, start asap
    - if never leetcoded, start leetcoding, look to apply around exam time in May (best prepped for interviews, including info from modules)
- what to do?
    - leetcode
    - neetcode (sys design, algo course, do in his order, pay for premium)



## Programming Tips

- you should definitely know before the course starts:

1. Python (very comfortable)
    - minimum level would comfortably being able to code a hangman game (with classes, functions, loops, file I/O)
    - recommended is doing actual projects
2. HTML, CSS, (+ JavaScript) (+ very basic understanding of how websites work) - basic understanding
3. SQL - basic understanding
4. Command - basic understanding

don't wait until the course starts to learn it as won't be good enough to do well in course and interviews
